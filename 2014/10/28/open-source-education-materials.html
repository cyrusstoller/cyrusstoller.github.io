  <h1>Open source education materials</h1>

<div id="post">
  <p>Software developers work together on open source projects that
help to power products and services that are changing the world.
This collaborative atmosphere is conducive to learning how
to write good software.
Recently, I’ve been wondering whether these open source principles
could be used to help teachers improve their curriculum materials.</p>

<p>Sites like <a href="https://github.com/">Github</a> make it easy for users to engage with 
and observe the development process of open source projects. 
In addition to being a datastore for the actual software, <a href="https://github.com/">Github</a> 
has created a social network that users can harness to assign 
credibility to projects that they may build on in future work.
Based on the assumption that good developers know other
good developers, users can figure out how to prioritize which projects to
pay close attention to. 
For example, if the maintainer of Project A, whom I respect, is
contributing to Project B, I’m more likely to follow the progress
of Project B over Project C, which is written by people I don’t know.</p>

<h2 id="hypothesis">Hypothesis</h2>

<p>My hypothesis is that professional educators would be willing to 
foster a community for open source course materials. 
Of course, most won’t contribute. That’s fine. 
The vast majority of software developers do not contribute to open
source software either.</p>

<p>Websites like <a href="http://www.teacherspayteachers.com/">TeachersPayTeachers.com</a> allow teachers to buy, sell,
and share teaching materials. But, to me a five star rating system from
anonymous users that I don’t know feels like a website operating before
social media.Another issue with such data warehouse sites is that the materials
are relatively static.</p>

<p>Building a network that allows users to assess credibility is much more 
nuanced.
To do this effectively, you need to foster a community where people can
build and track meaningful relationships with other users.
 One of the most exciting things about <a href="https://github.com/">Github</a>
is that repositories are alive and constantly changing.
The same should be true of the materials that teachers use in
the classroom.</p>

<h2 id="potential-workflow">Potential workflow</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Imagine that I’m a high school history teacher looking for
inspiration for new ways to teach a lesson on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federalist_Papers">Federalist Papers</a>.
I look up another teacher whom I met at a conference, and look at the
lesson plans he/she has shared.</li>
  <li>I may find some ideas that would work well
with the lesson that I’m planning. In addition to communicating the material
clearly. I also want  to find ways to present these concepts in a way that 
students can more easily relate to, making my lessons more impactful.</li>
  <li>If I still want more inspiration, I may look at lessons that his/her friends 
have shared. This will have a higher success rate than trying to select from  a large
number of lessons from an impersonal marketplace.</li>
  <li>After my lesson, I can give feedback back to the network on how to improve the
lesson based on student reactions. These insights can be used to
refine the lesson for future use by myself and/or other teachers.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="benefits">Benefits</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Helping teachers of any age/experience gain exposure / recognition for high quality lessons</li>
  <li>Hiring committees can get a sense of how he/she thinks based on portfolio of contributions</li>
  <li>Harnessing contributions from non-teachers who may be subject matter experts</li>
  <li>Making file sharing easy (especially with large multimedia files)</li>
  <li>Sharing potential sources of confusion for students and how to address these questions</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="next-steps">Next Steps</h2>

<p>If you have thoughts about this idea, I’d love for you to send me an 
<a href="mailto:cyrus.stoller@gmail.com?subject=[Blog] Open Source Education Materials">email</a>.
And if there’s enough interest, I could be persuaded to start this website as an
open source project.</p>
