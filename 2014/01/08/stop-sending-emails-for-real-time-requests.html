  <h1>Stop sending emails for real time requests</h1>

<div id="post">
  <p>We’re in an unfortunate equilibrium where it’s not uncommon for people to expect under one hour
response times to emails. In my view, emails should <em>not</em> be used to
communicate information that requires immediate action.
Most people I interact with have smartphones; we should agree to use different channels of 
communication to convey purpose. We’re no longer restricted to just phone calls and email.</p>

<h2 id="if-i-had-my-way-this-is-how-i-would-have-people-communicate-their-requests">If I had my way this is how I would have people communicate their requests.</h2>

<p><em>Disclaimer:</em> Realistically this will only work with people you communicate with often
e.g. employees/co-workers, family, and close friends.</p>

<p><strong>tl;dr</strong> 
If you need something to be done in:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>30 minutes:</em> <strong>call</strong><br />
<em>two hours:</em> <strong>text</strong><br />
<em>today:</em> <strong>IM</strong><br />
<em>a day or later:</em> <strong>email</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="priority-0---voice-call">Priority 0 - Voice Call</h3>

<p>If you need something to have been done five minutes ago, call my cell phone. 
This gives you an opportunity to make sure I understand exactly what you need done and
you know exactly when I received your request.</p>

<p>If you don’t feel comfortable interrupting what I’m doing to make a request to me directly
then it probably isn’t that urgent and can wait a little while. Be considerate of what I may
be doing and that it may take a while to get back in “the zone” after your interruption.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Litmus test:</strong> If we were in the same room and I was talking to someone else would you
feel comfortable breaking up my conversation and taking me aside? If not, then a voice call
is <em>not</em> the appropriate choice.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="priority-1---sms">Priority 1 - SMS</h3>

<p>If you need something done in the next couple hours, send me a text that says something like
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">call me asap</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">call me when you hit a break point</code>.</p>

<p>This gives me time to gracefully wind down what I’m doing and call you back. I think most things 
that people find urgent fall in this category. It needs to be done soon, but it can wait up to 
30 minutes to an hour.</p>

<p>Group text messages are dangerous territory here because everyone will be interrupted
when someone responds. If I had my way, people would limit group texts to when they need
to broadcast information rather than when they are trying to finalize logistics.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Litmus test:</strong> If we were in the same room and I was talking to someone else would you
feel comfortable signaling to me to wind down my conversation?
If not, then an SMS is <em>not</em> the appropriate choice.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="priority-1a---instant-messaging">Priority 1a - Instant Messaging</h3>

<p>Instant message works well for slightly more asynchronous communication. You’re interested in 
getting a short response promptly, but it doesn’t need to be right away. This is less disruptive
than calling or texting. This works well when you need to find out a concrete piece of information 
before you can proceed.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Litmus test:</strong> If we were in the same room and I was in the middle of reading something would
you feel comfortable leaving me a hand written note?
If not, then an instant message is <em>not</em> the appropriate choice.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="priority-2---email">Priority 2 - Email</h3>

<p>Email should be reserved for requests that you want addressed within the next day or so.
Ideally it would be acceptable for people to only check their email a few times per day.</p>

<p>To differentiate between informational emails, I’d like for people to specify whether 
action is required at the beginning of the subject line. Some people think that seeing
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">[Action Required]</code> prefixing email subjects to be a bit severe, but adding a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">plz reply</code>
indicates whether I need to deal with this right away or whether it can wait until I have
some more downtime.</p>

<p>Most people I know feel like they have too many emails to deal with. Think twice about whether
email is the right way to communicate your information. 
You should expect email threads to be truly <strong>asynchronous</strong>. I want people to move away
from expecting near real time responses.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Litmus test:</strong> Is this request something that you would feel comfortable dropping in an inbox 
on my desk when I wasn’t there? If not, then an email is <em>not</em> the appropriate choice.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Regardless of whether this convention works for you, I would recommend having an explicit
convention with people that you communicate with often.</p>
