  <h1>Does computer science belong at a liberal arts college?</h1>

<div id="post">
  <p>To skeptics, studying at a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_arts_college">liberal arts college</a> is synonymous with
studying things that aren’t practical. To me, the liberal arts ethos is less
about what students study and more about the process of learning. A liberal
arts education prioritizes refining critical thinking over learning particular
facts (e.g. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generally_Accepted_Accounting_Principles_(United_States)">GAAP accounting</a> rules). As a result, mastery is defined by
your ability to teach yourself new things in the future.</p>

<h2 id="is-computer-science-too-vocational">Is computer science too vocational?</h2>

<p>It depends on how it’s taught. If a liberal arts college were to take the
approach that vocational bootcamps are taking, then I’d say the answer is yes.
But, from what I’ve observed from friends who have gone through these
bootcamps, my experience studying computer science at <a href="https://www.swarthmore.edu/">Swarthmore</a>
was different; it was more focused on theory. Unlike bootcamps, Swarthmore
doesn’t offer a course on how to deploy a web application or how to use a
package management system. And when I did write code for class, it was in a
tightly controlled environment to stay focused on wrestling through conceptual
challenges. In contrast, my friends, who have gone through bootcamps, seem to
place a larger emphasis on getting a full system of tools working with each
other instead of thinking through which algorithm would work best. As an
example, in a bootcamp setting, students would likely use whichever <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sort</code>
function is available, while, in a liberal arts college setting, students would
focus on the tradeoffs between different <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorting_algorithm">sorting algorithms</a>
and learn about which contexts would warrant each one.</p>

<p>A liberal arts college should <em>not</em> make its primary focus teaching the facts
that students will need to know to start a job immediately; that’s what
training from employers is for. This isn’t to say that students shouldn’t learn
particulars (e.g. <a href="https://rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a>), but they <em>should</em> be able to learn
particulars on their own relatively easily outside the classroom. Given the
pace that programming languages and their accompanying frameworks evolve,
specifics quickly go stale. It’s a real asset to be able to teach yourself new
skills to stay competitive.</p>

<p>Labs and assignments to write programs that need to meet specifications don’t
make computer science vocational any more than labs in the natural sciences
(e.g. chemistry); programming assignments are meant to teach students lessons
that help improve mastery. It so happens that these same skills happen to have
professional value right now, but that isn’t the primary motivation for
assigning them.</p>

<p>Similar to the process of learning a foreign language, there are certain facts
that need to be learned before you can move forward. When taking introductory
Chinese, this entails memorizing characters and vocabulary. When taking
introductory computer science, this entails learning syntax and learning how to
thinking in a highly structured way that can be translated into code. So while
there are some relatively rote mechanics in intro computer science courses,
these are key foundational elements for students to understand before they can
approach more advanced topics. Just because there is an element of the computer
science curriculum that is more mechanical, that shouldn’t disqualify computer
science from belonging at a liberal arts college any more than introductory
foreign language courses.</p>

<h2 id="forms-of-literacy">Forms of literacy</h2>

<p>To me, the goal of a liberal arts education is to make students literate in all
senses of the word. This explains the importance of students having exposure to
the humanities, social sciences, and natural sciences. Right now, I think
there’s broad agreement that students should have read the works of important
thinkers and be familiar with basic mathematical tools like statistics that are
used heavily in the social sciences. I’ll call these: 1) literacy; and 2)
numerical literacy. In the near future, I think there will be broad consensus
that 3) technical literacy should be added to this list.</p>

<p>I suspect that computer science will eventually be treated like statistics;
it’s a tool that’s key for students to understand in many departments. In many
cases a basic computer science course will be considered a prerequisite for
higher level courses. Or, basic computer science may be treated as a course
like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Econometrics">econometrics</a> (statistics / economics) or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_philosophy">political
theory</a> (philosophy / political science) that is internalized
by other departments. Regardless of where these concepts are taught, it will be
understood that students should have familiarity with how to use a computer for
more than just surfing the internet and word processing. Computers are tools
that allow us to ask questions that were prohibitively expensive before. Every
student should be equipped with the tools to ask (and answer) questions. The
only way to do that is to be familiar with the universe of questions that are
reasonable to ask.</p>

<p>Once this is accepted, I imagine there also will be resources to help students
to write clean code in the same way that there are resources available to
students to help them improve their writing and clarity of thought. The process
of writing a good essay and writing a good program have a lot in common. It
takes deep understanding to make complicated concepts simple and accessible.
While a program may run invisibly in the background, as soon as you start
collaborating with others the quality of code quickly becomes a factor in how
fast you can make forward progress because everyone needs to understand what
the code is doing.</p>

<p>Writing a program that is technically correct but incomprehensible isn’t worth
much for the same reason that a long protracted sentence that is technically
correct but hard to read isn’t worth much. Being able to express oneself
clearly is one of the key hallmarks of a liberal arts college graduate. Given
that computers are here to stay, there’s no reason to exclude software from
being a way for students to be able to express themselves.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Saying that someone is studying computer science is often mistakenly used
interchangeably with learning to write software. To me, that’s a gross
oversimplification. Programming is a means to exploring models of computing.
Everyone should know how to program. But, that’s different from everyone
needing to take higher level computer science courses like
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiler">compilers</a>.</p>

<p>Computer science departments have an important role to play on liberal arts
college campuses. They help broaden students horizons and bring a different
perspective to how students think about problems like data privacy and
information sharing that are key contemporary questions for the social sciences
and humanities to examine.</p>

<p>With large data sets (public and private) available for almost any imaginable
topic, the challenge is to think of the right question. Fishing for answers is
more likely to be ineffective and unpredictable. So, insight will require
hypotheses based on critical thinking, and the best preparation to ask these
questions is a liberal arts education.</p>
