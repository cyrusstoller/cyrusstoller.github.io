  <h1>Guide to creating your first screencast</h1>

<div id="post">
  <p>These days it feels like most websites have an introductory video on their
homepage. So, I figured it was time for me to create a short screencast to
describe what <a href="https://www.hoshon.com/">Hoshon</a> is and how it works. But, since I had never made
a screencast before there were a lot of things that I needed to figure out. In
this post, I’m sharing what I learned so that you’ll be able to get up and
running a little faster.</p>

<p>Before you take my word for how it went, here’s the video I made:</p>

<div class="video-border">
  <div class="video-container">
    <iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/325965564" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen="">
    </iframe>
  </div>
</div>

<h2 id="planning">Planning</h2>

<p>To start, I needed to answer a simple question: what do I want people to learn
from watching my video? I settled on showing viewers only the most basic
information about <a href="https://www.hoshon.com/">Hoshon</a>. For me, this meant focusing my video on the
key <a href="https://www.hoshon.com/">Hoshon</a> workflow to demonstrate the value proposition. While I
struggled with leaving interesting features out of the video, at the end of the
day, objectively I know that <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.714.195&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf">shorter videos are more
effective</a>.</p>

<p>This introductory video is meant to earn the right to show the viewers
additional features during a demo call or after they sign up.</p>

<p>Knowing what I wanted to convey was helpful, but next I needed to decide <em>how</em>
I wanted to share it. Some videos seem to offer a laundry list of features and
are trying to compete on “specs”. Others seem to focus on the high level value
proposition without giving many specifics or actual screenshots. I decided to
take the approach of telling the story of a hypothetical user. This may not be
right for every circumstance, but it seems to be working well for me.</p>

<p>I chose to tell my story using characters from Winnie the Pooh because the cast
of characters lent themselves to humor and most people would already be
familiar with them. Whether you choose Winnie the Pooh, Star Wars, or Harry
Potter, choosing a set of familiar fictional characters helps people connect
with the story you’re telling. This allows you to show the process of your
product actually working,  instead of telling users how your product works.
Even if the substantive content is the same, showing viewers something is more
powerful than telling them the same thing.</p>

<p>After deciding to use a story to introduce users to <a href="https://www.hoshon.com/">Hoshon</a>, I made a
list of what I wanted to show and then tried to cut it in half to keep my video
short. It was frustrating to leave off seemingly important information, but I
kept reminding myself that I’m competing for limited time/attention. My goal is
to get viewers interested in <a href="https://www.hoshon.com/">Hoshon</a>, so that I would have the
opportunity to explain more in the future, not to explain everything. Once I
decided on what to include, I wrote a script that integrated my core content
with Winnie the Pooh.</p>

<p>To get more concrete, a minute of voiceover is roughly equivalent to one page
of prose that is triple spaced. This means that in effect you will have 500
words to communicate everything. But of those 500 words, you need to reserve
some for platitudes and transitions, and some to remind people of what you have
already told them earlier in the video. So in essence, you should try to boil
you message down to 250 words.</p>

<h2 id="scripting">Scripting</h2>

<p>Start your video with an introduction of who you are and a single sentence
describing what you are going to demonstrate. Think of this as your thesis
sentence; viewers need context on what they are about see. Your thesis needs to
clearly communicate your key value proposition. Try to keep this as simple as
possible. No matter how technical your product is, you should be able to
explain it to a middle schooler.</p>

<p>For <a href="https://www.hoshon.com/">Hoshon</a>, I wanted to make it clear that users can manage repeatable
processes using standardized checklists. This means that each time users create
a checklist for a given task, they are going to have the exact same steps.</p>

<p>Next, I wanted to highlight how <a href="https://www.hoshon.com/">Hoshon</a> improves consistency and
accountability. Then, I worked backwards and folded all of that information
into my demo checklist.</p>

<p>After you’ve written out exactly what you want to say, show it to a friend to
be sure it makes sense to someone who’s not thinking much about your product.</p>

<p>Lastly, practice voicing over your demo with the script so that you don’t
stumble over your words. It’s hard to talk and give a demo at the same time!</p>

<h2 id="recording">Recording</h2>

<p>Before recording this video I had used QuickTime to record my screen, but I
wanted to restrict the recording to just the web browser. Then I stumbled
across this great <a href="https://medium.com/@suzhinton/my-twitch-live-coding-setup-b2516672fb21">blog post</a>.</p>

<p>I’m glad I found out about <a href="https://obsproject.com/">OBS</a>; it does exactly what I need and, as a
bonus, it’s open source. There are other good tools like
<a href="https://www.telestream.net/screenflow/overview.htm">ScreenFlow</a> or <a href="https://www.techsmith.com/video-editor.html">Camtasia</a>, but OBS gave me all the
functionality I was looking for, so that’s what I went with. The main things
that you’ll need to do in OBS are: create a scene with the window you want to
capture, and set your audio input so that as you speak it peaks around -12dB.
I’m using a <a href="https://www.bluedesigns.com/products/yeti/">Blue Yeti microphone</a>. If you can afford it, I’d
recommend using a stand alone microphone. People can tell the difference in
audio quality.</p>

<h2 id="post-production">Post Production</h2>

<p>After I recorded the video, I needed to do some editing. While I tried to get
through my script in a single pass, I inevitably either stumbled on my words or
forgot to move my mouse at the right time. So, for post production, I re-taught
myself how to use Adobe Premiere. The big thing I needed from Adobe Premiere
that I couldn’t figure out how to do in iMovie was adding annotations over the
video (i.e. adding boxes to call attention to certain parts of the screen).</p>

<p>Going through the footage reminded me a lot of my War News Radio days. For
example, I cut audio segments before/after breaths so that it’s harder to tell
where I cut the footage. It also occurred to me that this may be the reason
that a lot of video productions use multiple camera angles. While it’s pretty
easy to cut audio in indiscernible ways, cutting video would be pretty tough.
But, if you’re changing angles anyway, it’s easier to hide.</p>

<p>I experimented with adding some background music, but generally found it to be
distracting. It’s amazing how hard it is to find music that strikes the right
mood. In the end I just added some music for an outro. I was looking for a
media equivalent of the <a href="https://thenounproject.com/">Noun Project</a> to find music. Is there
one? I’d love to be introduced to one, if it exists, since I’m going to be
making more videos. I ended up using <a href="https://icons8.com/music">icon8</a> and the <a href="https://freemusicarchive.org,">free music
archive</a>, which offer royalty free music. (Edit: Here’s a
<a href="https://github.com/LisaDziuba/Awesome-Design-Tools">list of tools</a> that I’ll consider using in the
future.)</p>

<h2 id="posting">Posting</h2>

<p>The last decision regarding my video was about whether to host it on
<a href="https://youtube.com/">YouTube</a>, <a href="https://vimeo.com/">Vimeo</a>, or directly on AWS. I ended up choosing to
go with Vimeo because it allows me to update videos while keeping the same URL,
while also providing a nice looking player and pro features that I can
hopefully grow into.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Thanks for reading. Hope you have found this helpful. Writing this up has
helped me clarify my thought process for the next time I make a screencast.
Would love to see the videos you make. Happy hacking!</p>
