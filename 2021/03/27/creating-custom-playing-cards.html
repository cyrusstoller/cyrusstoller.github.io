  <h1>Creating custom playing cards</h1>

<div id="post">
  <p>My family enjoys playing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contract_bridge">bridge</a>. It’s one of the games we enjoy
playing most with my grandmother (she still kicks our butts and can count cards
better than us). To celebrate her 101st birthday, I thought it would be fun to
make a custom deck of cards to share with family and friends since we couldn’t
host an in-person celebration this year due to COVID. In this post, I want to
share how I went about creating a small run of playing cards that incorporated
some fun family jokes and symbology while being of high enough quality that we
would still want to play bridge with them.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-print-a-small-run-of-playing-cards">How to print a small run of playing cards</h2>

<p>YouTube is full of wisdom. I was lucky to stumble upon <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKvGM5-F0D8">this video</a>
created by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnbSssjaMs0ZYTfAemM4LWg">Rise Magic</a> where they explained their process to
create the prototype for <a href="https://rise-magic.com/store/rise-playing-cards">their deck of cards</a>. After watching their
video, I had a good sense of the defaults I should use when printing the decks
with <a href="https://www.makeplayingcards.com/">MakePlayingCards</a>.</p>

<p>Here are some cliff notes when selecting the type of cards to have printed so
that they’re of a quality that you’d actually want to play with:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Poker size game cards (<a href="https://www.makeplayingcards.com/design/custom-blank-card.html">custom blank</a>)</li>
  <li>Use the M31 Linen card stock</li>
  <li>Beta finish</li>
  <li>You may want to use <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1fM_Mwpf5lENqGGFaZ7ZozDLaYy-Jk5NH">these Illustrator files</a> that look like the
standard <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Playing_Card_Company">USPCC</a> card faces instead of the standard faces provided by
MakePlayingCards</li>
</ul>

<p>Once I had an idea of logistically how to get the cards printed, I needed
some help designing three main elements:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The back design</li>
  <li>Tuck case</li>
  <li>A custom card face for the Queen of Hearts that featured my grandmother’s
face</li>
</ol>

<p>With my level of Illustrator skills, I was able to handle a few other areas of
design:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Jokers in the shape of maple leaves since my grandmother was born in
Vancouver.</li>
  <li>Ace of Spades that incorporates an outline of San Francisco with a Spade cut
out of it.</li>
  <li>An “Ad” card where my brother and I added a Haiku. In hindsight, I would
have left this out, since we only really needed this for the version that we
gave to our grandmother.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="finding-a-designer">Finding a designer</h2>

<p>I posted a job listing on three sites: <a href="https://dribbble.com/freelance-jobs">Dribbble</a>, <a href="https://www.upwork.com/">UpWork</a>,
and <a href="https://www.fiverr.com/">Fiverr</a>.</p>

<p>Here’s what I listed:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Title</strong>: Custom tuck case for deck of cards</p>

  <p>My grandma is turning 101 at the end of the month. She loves playing bridge
and I thought that it’d be fun to celebrate her birthday with a custom deck
of cards for her and the rest of our family. I’m looking for some help
designing a custom tuck case for the deck of cards.</p>

  <p>I’m hoping for some help designing the tuck case (and potentially a custom
face of the Queen of hearts).</p>

  <p>Here’s the rough concept I have in mind:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>I would like the tuck case to look similar to the
<a href="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0047/0768/0291/products/IMG_8200_d000d623-ece3-4b59-baee-1c516de547f2.jpg">Tally-Ho tuck case</a></li>
    <li>Instead of it saying “A Dougherty” across the top I would like it to say
“Chez Lopez”</li>
    <li>Where it says “Tally-Ho” I would like it to say “Takako”</li>
    <li>Where it says “Linoid Finish” I would like it to say “AKA BUBS”</li>
    <li>And then instead of saying “No. 9” I would like it to say “No. 101”</li>
  </ul>

  <p>If this is something that you’d be interested in helping me create, please
reach out. I’d like to get started ASAP.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Between these three sites, I received 35+ replies within 24 hours. I started
conversations with 12 designers whose responses indicated that they had read my
post. After a little back and forth, I ultimately talked on the phone with 4
designers and then decided to work with <a href="https://dribbble.com/TimesNewAlli">Alli Elster</a>, whom I
found on Dribbble. Part of what excited me about working with Alli was her past
experience with designs <a href="https://dribbble.com/shots/6173524-Deadbolt-Bar-deck-of-cards">involving playing cards</a>.</p>

<p>Given that this brief was pretty concrete, I appreciated that Alli was willing
to offer a fixed price quote. Alli did great work and the cards turned out
exactly as I had hoped! I’ve started working on another project with her. If
you are looking for a talented, personable designer, I highly recommend working
with Alli!</p>

<h2 id="potential-gotchas-when-uploading-images">Potential gotchas when uploading images</h2>

<p>When I uploaded images to <a href="https://www.makeplayingcards.com/">MakePlayingCards</a>, I wasn’t sure what
resolution would be necessary for the images not to be fuzzy because the
previews were pretty small. If you have the option, export the images you want
to use at a much higher resolution than you think you need to ensure that
everything comes out crisply when it’s printed. I exported images that are 4x
larger than required.</p>

<p>The other area where I made a mistake was in uploading the box design.
You may want to print out the pdf template with your design on it and try
folding it before you finalize your order. I found that I should have rotated
one of the face designs 180º from what I had added initially.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>I found this process pretty fun. And the cards have gone over well with the
family. I hope this blog post can help speed up your learning process if you
decide to try something similar.</p>
