  <h1>Managing loneliness during COVID-19</h1>

<div id="post">
  <p>Yesterday the San Francisco Bay Area <a href="https://www.sfdph.org/dph/alerts/files/HealthOrderC19-07-%20Shelter-in-Place.pdf">was ordered to shelter in place</a> due
to growing concerns about the spread of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus_disease_2019">COVID-19</a>. I’m fully supportive of
the government putting measures in place to ensure that people are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_distancing">social
distancing</a> themselves to help ease the load on our health care system
during this pandemic. While this may feel drastic now, I’m proud of our local
government for proactively responding to this public health emergency. If
anything, I worry that this measure may be too late.</p>

<p>This post isn’t about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus_disease_2019">COVID-19</a> itself. It’s about some of the side effects
that we may encounter from our response to this disease. In particular, I’m
concerned about social isolation and loneliness during this 3 week period of
sheltering in place. I can only imagine what this experience must be like for
people who live by themselves or live with people who they are not particularly
close to (e.g., a questionable Craigslist roommate).</p>

<p>Last night, my girlfriend and I tried an experiment. We posted a link to an
open Google Hangout and told our friends that we were going to be online for a
couple hours hosting a virtual happy hour / dinner / dessert party. We weren’t
sure if anyone was going to show up or if it would be awkward for friends who
didn’t know each other to be on the same video chat. There were certainly some
momements that were a little awkward, but all in all, I think it was a
success and I plan on doing it again.</p>

<p>After we signed off of the Google Hangout, I couldn’t help but reflect on the
impact that sheltering in place will have on our collective mental health.
Regardless of how introverted we are (myself included), we all need some social
interaction. For many people, seeing colleagues at work, or sitting next to
people on public transit is a reminder that we are part of a greater community.
When we stay at home it’s easy to lose touch with those around us.</p>

<p>My concern is that many people will face mental health challenges, or at least
bouts of loneliness, during this period of isolation.</p>

<p>Those of us who have the privilege of being surrounded by people who we care
about (and who care about us) should make concerted efforts to reach out. <strong>If
you’re willing, I’d encourage you to consider calling friends who you think may
be spending significant amounts of time alone, even if you haven’t talked to
them in a long time.</strong> Even a short conversation (10-15 minutes) will go a long
way. It’s good for you and it’s good for them.</p>

<p>Anyway, food for thought as we enter uncharted territory. Stay safe and wash
your hands.</p>
