  <h1>Using WhatsApp for political organizing</h1>

<div id="post">
  <p>A friend was recently sending messages to voters in Georgia before the upcoming
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020%E2%80%9321_United_States_Senate_election_in_Georgia">runoff</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020%E2%80%9321_United_States_Senate_special_election_in_Georgia">elections</a> using <a href="https://www.whatsapp.com/">WhatsApp</a>
and he had an experience that reminded me of the power <a href="https://www.facebook.com/">Facebook</a> holds over
our ability to effectively and freely communicate. In this case, the support
team’s resolution seemed appropriate, but nevertheless unsettling.</p>

<p>To be clear, this post is <em>not</em> meant to be about Facebook and its policies;
it’s a broader reflection on our dependence on private companies to exercise our
democratic rights. This same scenario could have easily occurred using any
messaging service, not just WhatsApp.</p>

<h2 id="background">Background</h2>

<p>For the sake of this story, we’ll call my friend Paul.
Here’s some background information:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Paul has a WhatsApp account, but had not used it in a long time (3+ months).</li>
  <li>Most of Paul’s WhatsApp messages are in English, but there are also a
significant number of messages with people written in Spanish from when Paul
lived in Latin America.</li>
  <li>A political organizer had reached out to Paul about texting registered voters
in Spanish to ensure that they had a plan to vote in the upcoming
election.</li>
  <li>Paul installed the <a href="https://www.whatsapp.com/download/?lang=en">desktop WhatsApp application for Mac OS</a> for
the first time.</li>
  <li>Paul sent ~100 messages written in Spanish using the WhatsApp desktop
application to registered voters that followed a similar template, but that
were personalized with the voter’s name.
These messages were all sent over the course of ~1 hour.</li>
  <li>Paul received a message from WhatsApp that his account had been
banned for violating the <a href="https://www.whatsapp.com/legal/?lang=en&amp;doc=terms-of-service&amp;version=20200128">Terms of Service</a>.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>Your phone number +1 (XYZ) XYZ-WXYZ is banned from using WhatsApp. Please
contact customer support for assistance.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li>After providing a pdf of his latest phone bill to prove ownership of his phone
number, Paul was able to reactivate his WhatsApp account.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="reflection-on-the-situation-and-the-nature-of-spam">Reflection on the situation and the nature of spam</h2>

<p>I imagine that Paul’s relatively sudden change in behavior triggered an
automated system that flagged his account for spam activity.
This was likely due to the dramatic increase in messages being sent, message
similarity, messages being sent from the desktop application for the first time,
or a number of recipients flagging the messages as unwanted.</p>

<p>From WhatsApp’s point of view, it’s <em>hard to distinguish</em>
between unwanted messages being sent en masse and unwanted messages
being sent on a relatively small scale to strangers for political outreach.
Given that both types of messages are between parties that have never
communicated together before and where the recipients may not want to be
receiving the messages in the first place, there’s no obvious heuristic to tell
the difference between these use cases.</p>

<h2 id="resolution-paths">Resolution paths</h2>

<p>In this situation, I think WhatsApp could have sent Paul an automated
warning to say that he could not longer send messages to accounts who had not
responded to him for 72 hours while they assessed whether or not he was a real
person. Or, the automated message could share that Paul’s account had been
flagged for suspcious activity and would be shut off if the activity continued.
The automated messaged would have had the desired effect of limiting spam while
continuing to allow Paul to access his account.</p>

<p>Instead of taking this <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">warning</code> approach, Paul received a notification
that his account had been banned. Not only could he no longer
send messages, but he also could not look at previous messages that he had sent.
Understandably, some of the exchanges he’d had with his host family in Latin
America had sentimental value. So, the prospect of having his account banned in
trying to help a political cause he cared about seemed particularly stark.</p>

<h2 id="chilling-effect">Chilling effect</h2>

<p>While the net effect of WhatsApp’s current process for resolving this type of
situation and WhatsApp sending a warning that service will shut off may be the
same, the way in which the issue has been communicated to Paul made him worry
that he had <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brick_(electronics)">bricked</a> his phone number.</p>

<p>In other words, he could continue to use his phone, but if he ever
wanted to use WhatsApp again, he’d need to get a new phone number. This would be
a huge hassle because it would require reaching out to each of Paul’s contacts
and figuring out all of the services that use his phone number for
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-factor_authentication">multifactor authentication</a>, so that he wouldn’t inadvertently lock
himself out of other services.</p>

<p>Paul was also worried about how he’d handle future travel in Latin America.
Having WhatsApp is key for communication, so before the issue was resolved, Paul
started thinking about whether he’d need to get a “disposable” phone number the
next time he went on a trip to communicate with friends and AirBnB hosts.</p>

<p>The risk of having to resolve this kind of hassle was not what Paul bargained
for when he signed up to help the political organizer in Georgia.
The result of this experience is that Paul does <strong>not</strong> want to use his personal
WhatsApp again when helping to advance political causes he believes in.</p>

<h2 id="technology-and-political-campaigns">Technology and political campaigns</h2>

<p>Right now, poltical campaigns routinely ask volunteers to use their own
technology when reaching out to potential supporters. For phone calls, they
typically use an online <a href="https://www.thrutalk.io/">dialer</a> <a href="https://www.hubdialer.com/">service</a> that does not
require the volunteer to use their personal phone number. And for many
<a href="https://www.thrutext.io/">text message campaigns</a>, the same is true.</p>

<p>But, there’s another significant portion of outreach where volunteers and staff
members <em>do</em> use their personal phone numbers. Paul’s experience makes me
wonder whether campaign related outreach should go through registered
phone numbers (similar to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_code">short codes</a>) that would identify
themselves as associated with political campaigns so that recipients can decide
to opt out of if they’re not interested it receiving campaign calls and texts.
This seems like a system that would be better for voters not interested in being
bombarded before election day and for volunteers eager to engage in the
political system without the risk of unintended hassles related to their
personal phone subscriptions.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>This was a scenario where both Paul and WhatsApp were well-intentioned, but
has left Paul less enthusiastic about volunteering for political causes he
believes in. In the future, I hope political campaigns will work with service
providers to make it easier for volunteers to engage without this risk. I also
hope that private companies that facilitate communication will give users
warnings before making them feel like they’ve been banned for life.</p>
