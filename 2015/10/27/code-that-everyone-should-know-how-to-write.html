  <h1>Code that everyone should know how to write</h1>

<div id="post">
  <p>When people say that they’re learning to code, they usually mean that they’re
learning to make websites or mobile apps. Code schools typically teach basic
<a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a> and <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">Node.js</a>, aiming to prepare students for junior
software development roles. But, if that’s not what you’re aiming for, these
crash courses won’t help you.</p>

<p>In general, I think people would benefit more from learning to write simple
throw away scripts to automate tasks on their computers. Learning to code
shouldn’t just be about becoming a software engineer. It should be about being
more technoliterate and about improving productivity.</p>

<p>Novice coders should be encouraged by two observations about these disposable
programs. First, even when code is poorly written, the end product is usually
the same. Second, I hardly ever need to understand any concepts beyond arrays
and dictionaries to write them.</p>

<p>While understanding theory from my CS degree definitely helps me write better
software, for simple programs the rate limiting factor is human programming
time, not <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation">big O notation</a>. In
other words, writing slow code doesn’t make a difference. For example, if you
use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_sort">bubble sort</a> when you should
have used <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quicksort">quick sort</a> for a small
data set, the difference in runtime will barely be perceptible.</p>

<p>In the same way that not everyone who knows how to write prose will become a
professional author, not everyone who can code will become a professional
software developer. Instead of writing programs from first principles, people
uninterested in pursuing professional software development should start by
learning to use packages, libraries, and frameworks. Small victories and
solutions to personal problems will serve as good motivation to keep learning.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, learning to write these disposable scripts can be hard when you
don’t know where to start. Because these programs are highly specific to
particular tasks, people typically don’t share them on sites like <a href="https://github.com/">Github</a>.</p>

<h2 id="getting-started">Getting started</h2>

<p>You need to have the right mindset. Anytime you’re asked to perform the same
task more than once, ask yourself whether there’s a way to automate it. Here
are some examples of the types of scripts you should write.</p>

<h2 id="examples">Examples</h2>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Reorganizing data:</strong> It’s common to need to reorder text. Usually this
involves lots of highly error prone copy and paste. Next time, consider
writing a script in <a href="https://www.python.org/">python</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sed">sed</a>.</li>
  <li><strong>Standardizing data formats:</strong> For example if you want capitalization to be
consistent, it’s easy to forget to push <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">shift</code>, but the computer will make
sure everything looks the same.</li>
  <li><strong>Collecting information:</strong> Learn to write web scrapers to extract
information from websites.</li>
  <li><strong>Downloading datasets from government websites:</strong> Usually this take a lot
of clicking. Have you computer do it for you.</li>
  <li><strong>Renaming files:</strong> Instead of clicking each file and renaming it, you can
write a simple program to rename all of the files using a consistent naming
scheme.</li>
  <li><strong>Categorizing data / counting:</strong> When there’s a concrete rule for bucketing
data, your computer will be far faster and won’t complain about having to
redo work.</li>
  <li><strong>Removing duplicates:</strong> Because computers don’t go cross-eyed, they’re able
to find duplicates or near duplicates with ease.</li>
  <li><strong>Multiple clicks:</strong> If the clicks are predictable, then write a program to
execute multiple actions at once.</li>
  <li><strong>Analyzing Excel files with complicated logic:</strong> Because Excel only allow
ten conditional statements in a given cell, running any analysis with
complicated logic is nearly impossible.
Here’s a <a href="https://github.com/cyrusstoller/Pathfinder">simple program</a> I wrote that produces histograms of
paths through a network.</li>
  <li><strong>Running routine reports:</strong> If you need to generate the same report every
week based on dynamic data, you should automate that process. By lowering
the friction of generating these reports, you’ll make better use of your
data.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>If you do this, you’ll join the few who use computers as more than glorified
typewriters, internet browsers, and television sets. Please email me if you’re
interested in having me write up one of these examples. I’m happy to write a
follow up.</p>
