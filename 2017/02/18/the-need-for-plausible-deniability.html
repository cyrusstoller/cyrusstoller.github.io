  <h1>The need for plausible deniability</h1>

<div id="post">
  <p>While <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem)">4096-bit keys</a> can protect sensitive information from brute force attacks,
they’re easily circumvented if you’re put in a situation like the <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2017/2/12/14583124/nasa-sidd-bikkannavar-detained-cbp-phone-search-trump-travel-ban">US-born NASA scientist</a>,
who was pressured to divulge sensitive information <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/14/business/border-enforcement-airport-phones.html">to customs agents</a>.
Until recently, my security concerns have been primarily about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_hat">black-hat</a> activities,
but current events have shown that our government should be treated as an adversary in
the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Threat_model">threat model</a>.</p>

<p>Sadly, it’s naive to expect government to play by the rules (e.g. waiting for search warrants).
A president willing to push legal boundaries and arguably neglect his oath to
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oath_of_office_of_the_President_of_the_United_States">preserve, protect, and defend the constitution</a> can use the tools of government to subvert
democracy by routing out perceived opposition.
This intimidation undermines our sense of safety in our beliefs and sabotages freedom of expression.</p>

<p>The achilles heal of encryption is that adversaries typically know whether or not
they have been given the right key.
For example, if you provide the wrong password, the system will likely reject
your login attempt, so your interrogator will know that you have not provided truthful information.
This is particularly important when <a href="http://www.mit.edu/~specter/articles/17/deniability1.html">under duress</a>.
So to be effective, privacy tools need to support <strong>both</strong> sound encryption and plausible deniability.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>One idea to address this is for users to have two types of passwords:
<strong>one for genuine use, and one for duress.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>One of the big downsides to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biometrics">biometric</a> passwords is that you cannot hide them,
and that you can be forced to place your thumb on a fingerprint scanner.
So when possible, stay away from these types of passwords.
But, because it’s hard to remember so many passwords, people often turn to
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Password_manager">password managers</a> to store your passwords to other services.
Unfortunately, this leaves you particularly vulnerable if that password gets compromised.</p>

<p>With the solution that I’m proposing, you’d have two sets of passwords.
The first is the type that you’d use when trying to access your passwords
for everyday use. But, the second would be a separate accepted password that
would appear to login to a genuine account but would be full of dummy accounts and passwords.
Depending on your level of paranoia, these could be real accounts that you use from time to
time, but that have minimal sensitive information.</p>

<p>In practice, this could mean if you’re the victim of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robbery">mugging</a>,
you’d be able to provide an actual bank account, but one with a smaller balance
to help minimize your losses.</p>

<p>Similarly, I want medical professionals and attorneys to have duress
passwords to protect the privileged information of their patients and clients
if they’re put under duress.</p>

<p>Additionally, journalists traveling to countries with oppressive governments
may be asked for login credentials to their email and social media accounts
to check that they aren’t dissident sympathesizers and that they aren’t
associating with rebel forces.
It’d be great to be able to comply with their request, while concealing the
stories they’re writing.
In addition to using tools like <a href="https://tails.boum.org/">Tails</a> or <a href="https://www.qubes-os.org/">Qubes</a>, journalists would ideally be able to
login to their phones and computers to show that there’s nothing of interest.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>With increased fear-mongering by politicians, we need to continue building tools
that address the needs of law-abiding users, who are the overwhelming majority.
Unfortunately, there will always be bad actors.
But, this is not an excuse for the government to create loopholes in our privacy technologies, which potentially allow authorities to
catch them, while leaving everyone else as collateral damage. This is an unreasonably high price to pay.</p>

<p>We <strong>cannot</strong> abandon our legal tradition of
protecting the rights of the innocent, even when that means
accepting that some guilty people will walk free.
If we’re not careful, we’ll quickly allow the powerful to revert to the dark ages of “guilty until proven innocent,”
which run antithetical to our conception of freedom and democracy.</p>
