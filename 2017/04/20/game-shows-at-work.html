  <h1>Game shows at work</h1>

<div id="post">
  <p>As a product manager, I spend a lot of my time coordinating efforts between
different teams. Often, this requires me to help people appreciate what people
are doing in other parts of the company.
This includes giving them a sense of the challenges that others are facing
and to share ways that we can all help each other to achieve our goals.</p>

<p>One of the biggest hurdles is that people in different roles use different
vocabularies.
For example, when engineers start talking about potential obstacles they may encounter
when implementing a feature request from the sales team, a lot of what they’re
saying may as well be a foreign language.
Similarly, when talking about quotas or other key metrics that the sales
team is tracking, there isn’t a good point of comparison.</p>

<p>To help bridge this gap, I’ve started using popular TV game shows as a model to
make learning about key terms and metrics a fun, slightly competitive,
and hopefully good bonding experience.
Here are two examples that have worked pretty well for me.</p>

<h2 id="1-jeopardy">1. Jeopardy</h2>

<p><strong>Goal:</strong> Expose the company to vocabulary and facts that they all should know.</p>

<p>Putting terms into a game format makes it easy for people to
learn phrases that they may be too bashful to ask about since they seem
relatively basic.
Using a game allows me to remind people of basic information
without being condescending. 
For example, if there’s an acronym that people use all of the time,
ideally people will know what the acronym stands for.
But once it’s used frequently in conversation,
it’s undestandable how it quickly becomes awkward for someone to ask for
clarification about what it means.</p>

<p>I was surprised by how often people exclaimed things like:</p>

<ul>
  <li>“Oh, that’s what that means”</li>
  <li>“I’m glad I’m not the only one who didn’t know what that stood for”</li>
</ul>

<p>Each time I heard one of these statements, I knew that the game was
helping our team to work more effectively together.
I imagine that this will help to reduce miscommunication.</p>

<p>I also used these questions as an opportunity to share interesting
factoids about our team members (e.g. nicknames or favorite bands).
Especially for people who don’t get a chance to work together very
often, this has been good fodder for people to talk about
over lunch.</p>

<p><strong>Game Play:</strong> Typically, Jeopardy is game played by individuals,
but I wanted everyone to be able to participate.
To make it a team game, I split the company into teams based on where
they sit (i.e. upstairs and downstairs).
I randomly picked two people to start the game.
When players provided the right question for the answer
(apologies if the Jeopardy nomenclature is confusing), they
would tag in another person from their team.
In the future, I do want to be cognizant of people
feeling uncomfortable if they get stuck with the buzzer for too long.
For this first iteration, I had people buzz in by slapping the table
in front of them.
This worked pretty well, but there were a couple instances
where I would have liked to have a more automated buzzer system
so that I could have avoided having to make close calls.</p>

<p><strong>Questions:</strong> I came up with 60 questions -
half about things related to people in technical roles and half about
things related to people in business roles.
The technical questions ranged from knowing what <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">API</code> stands for,
to the names of third party services and frameworks we rely on,
to the names of internal services in our architecture.
The business questions ranged from knowing what <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ACV</code> stands for,
to knowing what each step or our sales process entails,
to knowing our company values.
Then, I split questions up in to categories and sorted them by difficulty,
so we could have <em>Jeopardy</em> and <em>Double Jeopardy</em>.</p>

<h2 id="2-the-price-is-right">2. The Price is Right</h2>

<p><strong>Goal:</strong> Expose the team to metrics that are important to the business.
Some of these were focused on operational objectives and others were
more to raise awareness of how much we spend on third party services.
My hope is that this would help everyone have a better perspective when
deciding what may be worth outsourcing.
To keep things light-hearted, I also sprinkled in
things like co-worker caffeine consumption and number of countries
that team members have lived in.</p>

<p>Like with <em>Jeopardy</em>, this was a good way to be sure that people are
aware of key metrics that each team is tracking.
One added benefit with <em>The Price is Right</em> is that I could
see the range of answers that people were submitting,
giving me insight into areas I need to do a better job explaining
in the future.</p>

<p><strong>Game Play:</strong>
<em>The Price is Right</em> is a game where people try to guess the value
of the product without going over.
In our case, I gave a clue and asked people to submit their guesses
to the <a href="https://github.com/cyrusstoller/price-is-right">chat bot I made</a> that they could interact with on Slack.
To simulate the flow from <em>The Price is Right</em>,
I divided the game into two sections:</p>

<p>1) Open game</p>

<p>During this portion of the game, I asked questions that involved larger
numbers so there would be lots of variation in people’s answers.
The chat bot I wrote made it easy to point out the extremes of the answers that
people offered, while not singling people out.</p>

<p>I scored each round by offering 10 points to the person with the closest
guess without going over, 5 points to the person who was 2nd closest
without going over, and 1 point to everyone else who did not go over.
And then I imposed a 1 point penalty for people who went over and
a 5 point penalty for the person with the highest guess that went over
the actual number.</p>

<p>The people with the best scores from each team then moved
on to the showcase showdown.
I was surprised by how often people were checking the leaderboard
that I incorporated into the chat bot.
I thought that we might just check it at the end of the game,
but many people seemed to enjoy seeing how they were stacking up.
Since the bot only identified people by nicknames that they chose,
people who wanted to fly under the radar were able to do that
and people who wanted to just be themselves were also able to do that.
Based on my experience, about half of players used a name that was
clearly traceable to them and half used innocuous names that
were harder to trace back to them.</p>

<p>2) Showcase showdown</p>

<p>Since this was a team event, I wanted to rally everyone together.
I took the top player from each team and had them advance to the showcase showdown.
I first explained the rules of what was going to happen and then offered
the player with the highest score the choice of whether to go first
or to let the other team go first.</p>

<p>At the beginning, the teams alternated answering questions.
First, each team was presented with bundles of items and asked to
identify which one when added together was a multiple of 10.
Next, they were asked to identify which of three items’ values
did not include a particular digit.
For example, which of three clues does <strong>not</strong> contain a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">1</code> in it.</p>

<p>At this point, I explained that there were two remaining sets of questions.
The first would require a team to fill in the blank with a set of digits.
For example, they’d be shown:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Place the [1,3,7]
Number of commits in a particular repository: 5_14
Number of phone calls connects in the last week: _63
Number of leads collected at the last meetup: 1_2
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The team in the lead was given the option to answer this set of questions
or defer and wait to find out what the next set of questions would entail.</p>

<p>And for the last set of questions, I asked the team to determine
which of two clues was larger. At first, they thought this would be
easier, but in the end found it to be pretty hard.</p>

<p><strong>Questions:</strong> I came up with 60 numbers -
roughly a third about data quality and engineering,
a third about sales, marketing, and customer success,
and a third about people or things around the office.
For example, I asked how many square feet our office is
and how many calls one of our sales reps had made in his first year with the company.
I used about half of the numbers I wanted people to know about in the
open game and then used the remaining half in the showcase showdown.</p>

<p>I was careful to be sure that teams were aware that I’d be sharing their
metrics. I didn’t want anyone to be caught off guard or to feel embarrassed.
I’m glad I asked for sign off because there were a couple numbers that I thought
would probably be fine, but turned out to be a little sensitive.
My goal was to raise awareness, not to shine a spotlight on areas that I or anyone
else feels need improvement.</p>

<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>

<p>Overall, I think these games have been a huge success.
If your company culture is open to these kinds of games, I’d highly recommend it.
I’m trying to figure out which game I’d like to try next.
Please let me know if you have any suggestions.</p>

<p><em>Shameless plug:</em> I’d appreciate it if you could give my <a href="https://github.com/cyrusstoller/price-is-right">chat bot</a>
a star on Github.</p>
